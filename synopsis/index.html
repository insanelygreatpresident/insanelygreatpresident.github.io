  <h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>It is two years before the 2016 elections and the various candidates for the Republican, Democratic, and other
parties start putting their hats in to the race.  Most are unelectable: they have platforms that simply will not
win their party, or if it did, it would not win the general election.  But they decide to go in or out not because
they are or want to be a great president, but usually for other political and personal reasons.</p>

<p>During this same season, on a dark tennis court at 5AM, a highly committed, educated, and unusually talented person
sits to take a break from his morning routine.  This is no politician: he graduated from Caltech, is a software
and startup expert, and makes large sums of money helping protect Apple and others from their enemies.  At forty
eight he is preparing to challenge Rafeal Nadal and Roger Federrer.  A lot of people call him insane, but
strangely his insanity generally works, and helps the community in all kinds of interesting ways.</p>

<p>But making money has become meaningless, and beating Federrer would be interesting but not compelling.  Not meaningful.
&ldquo;What would be meaningful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his subconscious and conscious navigate through abilities and possibilities,
this older, balding, white male in the best intellectual and physical shape of his life realizes only one job is perfect
for him and he may be perfect for that job.  That more than four decades of incredible focus and progress has turned him
into the perfect executor.  Or delivery boy.  You tell him what you want, and he delivers it to you.  What is the best
possible delivery boy he could be?</p>

<p>And so a few minutes later he has his next career focus.  He wants to be great at one job, and to try to get that one
job.  President.  President of the United States of America.  Not just any president, an Insanely Great President.
A president better for the American people and even all of humanity than has been seen in decades.</p>

<p>This book will describe the preparation and the candidacy of a very different kind of person for one of the most
important jobs on the planet.  Whether he gets elected or not, it will show people a different kind of president,
and how that Insanely Great President would be better at <em>serving them</em> than anyone they have ever elected before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insanely Great President: To Serve and Protect&rdquo; will be Mark&rsquo;s second book.  Where The Slums of Palo Alto (&lt;<a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a>)
was a tale started thirty years in the past and spanned to current time,
IGP will be &ldquo;real-time&rdquo;, and span from January 2015 when Mark decided to become President of the United States of America,
through the elections in late 2016.</p>
