<div class="entry-content"><p>I do not know all the nuances of being a US President, but I have been CEO/President of multiple companies, and
have been the technical lieutenant to a half-dozen CEO/Presidents.  An important aspect of any job is to determine
whether you are a follower or not: whether you do what someone else says.  Note this has nothing to do with being
a leader or not.  If I transform the strategy of a game company into building the right software platform for the
games, I have to lead a number of engineers to make that happen.  The only time I am not a leader is when I don&rsquo;t
have any reports.  And in that case I still need to lead myself :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Many people think otherwise, but not being a follower is not a fun thing.  Being responsible for strategy where no
one is leading you, being responsible for success where no one is giving you constructive (even critical) feedback,
these are the terrors that can keep you up all night.  I have experience it as the CEO of Velidom.  And on a few
other occasions with much less at stake.  Being a CEO is incredibly lonely because of this.  You don&rsquo;t have a partner,
you don&rsquo;t have a leader, you just have yourself.  You are always to blame.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I think a US President has this one advantage: you must be a great leader (of millions people), but also have the
benefit of needing to be a great follower (of millions of people).  You work <em>for</em> the people of the USA, and even the
humanity of the whole world.  Whenever you aren&rsquo;t sure what you should do, just ask them.  My script is &ldquo;Imagine
I was President of the USA.  I work for you.  What would you like me to do?&rdquo;  I even have an online version of this
question at:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/InsanelyGreatPresident">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/InsanelyGreatPresident</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As of a week in, I have asked this question to a couple dozen people.  All of them were basically amazed by the concept.
That makes me very sad, because that means people don&rsquo;t feel they have a right (or all presidents don&rsquo;t believe they
have a right) to make this simple request.  But it seems obvious to me that the person running a democracy should ask the
people what they want him or her to do.  Elections are majority rule, but that is just so some decision can be made.
Elected presidents work for <em>all the people</em> not just the ones that elected them.</p>

<p>Among the couple dozen people, some were stymied.  Almost &ldquo;Oh my god!  What a powerful question!  Now I am in the hot
seat!&rdquo;.  Others just needed a bit of time.  Since I was asking people in my community, I just would come back periodically
to them to see if they were ready.</p>

<p>Interestingly, people got the sincerity and power of the question and so far have not given trite answers.  One girl
said &ldquo;My life is too good for me to make any requests&rdquo;, which is incredibly adult if not useful of an answer.  I will
bug her some more later :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Other answers have included:</p>

<pre><code>* I would like more money to spend
* I would like us to bring manufacturing back to the US
* I would like us to be friendlier in the Middle East
</code></pre>

<p>The last answer was very interesting because the conversation up to the answer was about economic difficulties living
where we do.  A moment earlier, we were talking about how this person really needed close to 3x the income to make
ends meet.  But when confronted with such a powerful question, the person switched to something more valuable than
money.</p>

<p>Pride.  In their country and its actions.</p>
