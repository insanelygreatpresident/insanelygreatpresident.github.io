<div class="entry-content"><p>I am planning on competing at the ATP tournament in Indian Wells in March.  As part of preparing for that tournament, I drove the sixteen-hour round trip in one day.
That was the first day I didn&rsquo;t play tennis (starting at 5AM) for about a year.  Every day, rain or shine, cold or hot, I go out to the court in appropriate attire
and practice.  It is both athletic and meditative.</p>

<p>The day after the Indian Wells trip, I went out for my normal ritual.  It is dark at 5AM, and the tennis court lights can&rsquo;t be turned on until 6:03AM.  After
 doing some of my practice, I sat there on the court.  I must have pondered winning Indian Wells and making a large some of money off that.  If I won, I
 could make quite a bit of money per year.  Playing tennis and being sponsored.  I already make quite a bit of money, so the obvious question to myself
 was &ldquo;why?&rdquo;.  Winning Indian Wells would be notable because I am pretty old: will be 48 years old at the tournament and will turn 49 the month after.
 So there might be some karmic benefit or interesting learning from winning that one tournament.  I was also planning on trying to win the US Open.
 That would be a real one-two punch to the youngsters.</p>

<p>But beyond the one or two punch combo&hellip; why?  Why would I play tennis for money?  What would it mean to the world?  How would I be impacting the world, and
why would I prefer that to my other choices?</p>

<p>I have a number of ways to make money, and I give away a lot of my time to help people (mostly kids).  This is fine, but if I am going to change, it should
be something better.  Ideally much better.  Much more impact.  Positive impact.</p>

<p>I ponder some more and consider my characteristics and abilities.  I care about people deeply.  I care about <em>everyone</em> and not some
specific group of people that matches some of the ideals I have.   I solve problems.  I am an execution expert and can deliver all kinds of great solutions
to solve other people&rsquo;s needs (or my own).</p>

<p>Where would an execution expert who cares deeply about the needs of everyone have the most positive impact?</p>

<p>Click.  There is one job that fills that bill exactly.  President.  President of a country.  President of my country.  POTUS.  President of the United States of America.</p>

<p>That is what I should try to be.  I could have great positive impact in the role.  I would work for hundreds of millions of people to protect and to serve them.
What do these people need?  What problems do they have?  What would be the best solution?  And how would I deliver that solution?</p>

<p>That is an awesome job.  And I may be insanely great at doing it.  But even if I am not elected, I can write about what I think (and experience) an
insanely great president would do.  To prepare, to get elected, and to serve the people of the USA when elected.</p>
