<div class="entry-content"><p>It is now a couple months later and I have been plugging through (a) reading about great presidents and leaders, (b)
reading the memoirs of military fighters, &copy; trying to figure out how to fund this presidency thing, and (d)
trying to sell the book before I write it.</p>

<p>But along with the progress (or at least efforts) above, Rebecca and I have been having a &lsquo;discussion&rsquo;.  You might
call it a fight, but it is both more respectful and less animated than a fight normally is.  The simple summary
is that Rebecca says I can&rsquo;t be president.  Not that I am unelectable or unskilled at the job, but that simply
she will not support me being president.  For two months we have been discussing this.</p>

<p>I love and respect Rebecca, but I deal with all the financial needs of our family, so if I need to get a job to make ends meet,
she can&rsquo;t rightfully &lsquo;veto&rsquo; that.  She would have to <em>first</em> make the money I am making, and then she could convince
me that a particular job wasn&rsquo;t the best use of my time.  My first reaction to her lack of support was to treat it as
&lsquo;unfair&rsquo; interference in my job.  I support her in her jobs and passions, she should support me in this area.  Yes,
it is an unusual job, but it is still a job and pays the bills (plus free rent for a few years!).</p>

<p>But recently during one of our interchanges, I realized there was one critical flaw in my logic.  I wasn&rsquo;t talking
 about one job: a job I do and then go home to the family.  It may not have always been true, but the modern presidency
 is <em>two jobs</em>.  President and First Partner (so far &lsquo;Lady&rsquo;).  Whether Rebecca would be paid as First Lady is irrelevant:
 she would clearly have to do the job.  Maybe not legally, but it would look horrible for her not to do the job.  And
 guilting someone into doing a job is as coercive as the many other means of force.  It is unfair.  I can&rsquo;t make her
 be First Lady.  She has to chose to be it (or &lsquo;possibly it&rsquo;) on her own.</p>

<p>Rebecca said no, so I am unfortunately &lsquo;blocked&rsquo; on this path until her opinion changes.  Seems unlikely to change any time soon,
but I am in good enough physical condition to last for a few more election cycles.</p>

<h2>Now What?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this unusual path was a major part of my life, so shutting it down is a bit problematic.  It is both
 constructively filling time for me and is enabling me to channel my energy and desire to &lsquo;Do Good&rsquo;.  If I can&rsquo;t (try to)
 be president, what can I do that would have as much impact?  Or more?</p>
