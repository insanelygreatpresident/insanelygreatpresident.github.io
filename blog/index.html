  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do not know the nuances of being a US President, but I have been CEO/President of multiple companies, and
have been the technical lieutenant to a half-dozen CEO/Presidents.  An important aspect of any job is to determine
whether you are a follower or not: whether you do what someone else says.  Note this has nothing to do with being
a leader or not.  If I transform the strategy of a game company into building the right software platform for the
games, I have to lead a number of engineers to make that happen.  The only time I am not a leader is when I don&rsquo;t
have any reports.  And in that case I still need to lead myself :&ndash;)</p>

<p>Many people think otherwise, but not being a follower is not a fun thing.  Being responsible for strategy where no
one is leading you, being responsible for success where no one is giving you constructive (even critical) feedback,
these are the terrors that can keep you up all night.  I have experienced it as the CEO of Velidom.  And on a few
other occasions with much less at stake.  Being a CEO is incredibly lonely because of this.  You don&rsquo;t have a partner,
you don&rsquo;t have a leader, you just have yourself.  You are always to blame.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I think a US President has this one advantage: you must be a great leader (of hundreds of millions people), but you also have the
benefit of needing to be a great follower (of hundreds of millions of people).  You work <em>for</em> the people of the USA, and even the
humanity of the whole world.  Whenever you aren&rsquo;t sure what you should do, just ask them.  My script is &ldquo;Imagine
I was President of the USA.  I work for you.  What would you like me to do?&rdquo;  I even have an online version of this
question at:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two critical aspects of any job are (a) Understanding what is required to submit your application to the proper people and (b) Understanding how great people have
done the job before.   Basically &ldquo;Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Then&rdquo; where &ldquo;Then&rdquo; could include the person currently in the position.</p>

<h2>Now</h2>

<p>For the Now, you have to understand what is required by the FEC and to be put on the ballot in the fifty states.  The basic information for all of this is at <a href="http://fec.gov">http://fec.gov</a></p>

<h2>Then</h2>

<p>For the Then, you have to decide what presidents inspire you and the people of the USA.  There is an advantage of studying current presidents in that the political world
is similar to what it will be for you.  There is an advantage of studying earlier presidents in that enough time has passed to more truly evaluate them.  Plus their
are more of them to pick and chose from than from the last two decades.</p>

<p>So we have (a) current or (b) earlier.  When given an apparent choice like that I have one common answer: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  There is no exclusion, just two options.  Picking
(a) or (b) exclusively would make you unbalanced and likely under-informed in a critical concept to the presidency.  So now that we have the full set of options
available, how do we prioritize which things to read first?  Well, at least one consideration has to be which materials match your time and abilities to read.  In
my case, I am very commonly in my car going somewhere.  So I can&rsquo;t read a book safely.  I need books on tape.  And not all books are on tape.  My second common
situation is being in my car waiting for someone.  At that point I can watch DVDs and read books.  Or even do both.  But again, I have to acquire the books and
some of them are harder than others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am planning on competing at the ATP tournament in Indian Wells in March.  As part of preparing for that tournament, I drove the sixteen-hour round trip in one day.
That was the first day I didn&rsquo;t play tennis (starting at 5AM) for about a year.  Every day, rain or shine, cold or hot, I go out to the court in appropriate attire
and practice.  It is both athletic and meditative.</p>

<p>The day after the Indian Wells trip, I went out for my normal ritual.  It is dark at 5AM, and the tennis court lights can&rsquo;t be turned on until 6:03AM.  After
 doing some of my practice, I sat there on the court.  I must have pondered winning Indian Wells and making a large some of money off that.  If I won, I
 could make quite a bit of money per year.  Playing tennis and being sponsored.  I already make quite a bit of money, so the obvious question to myself
 was &ldquo;why?&rdquo;.  Winning Indian Wells would be notable because I am pretty old: will be 48 years old at the tournament and will turn 49 the month after.
 So there might be some karmic benefit or interesting learning from winning that one tournament.  I was also planning on trying to win the US Open.
 That would be a real one-two punch to the youngsters.</p>

<p>But beyond the one or two punch combo&hellip; why?  Why would I play tennis for money?  What would it mean to the world?  How would I be impacting the world, and
why would I prefer that to my other choices?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My name is Mark Fussell, and I have an unusually large set of honed skills.  These I acquired by surviving Caltech, progressing through a total of ten+ startups,
writing multiple books, raising two daughters, building a relationship with a single wonderful woman over thirty years, becoming a patent expert, and
then a professional tennis player.  That alone might imply some significant depth and diversity.  But it  gets stranger: I am basically a trained financial
expert; a lawyer; a teacher of Robotics, Tennis, Programming, Publishing, and technology in general;
a very good skater and skier; a highly capable marksman with both bullets and arrows; a lover of philosophy and government;
and a driver of many &ldquo;classes&rdquo; of vehicles (Motorcycle, Car, and Bus/MH).</p>

<p>All of the above is due to (a) a love of learning, (b) an ability to focus and listen, and &copy; progressing through failure.  By this point, I have become
an &ldquo;Execution Expert&rdquo; or what I also call &ldquo;A Delivery Boy&rdquo;: you let me know what you want&hellip; and I will deliver that
to you.  As long as it doesn&rsquo;t violate my morals, I can basically do almost anything.  I might need others to help
out, but I will find them as needed.</p>

<p>So that is most of the skinny on me.  You can find out some other information at:</p>
