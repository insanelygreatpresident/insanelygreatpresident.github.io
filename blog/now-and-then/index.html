<div class="entry-content"><p>Two critical aspects of any job are (a) Understanding what is required to submit your application to the proper people and (b) Understanding how great people have
done the job before.   Basically &ldquo;Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Then&rdquo; where &ldquo;Then&rdquo; could include the person currently in the position.</p>

<h2>Now</h2>

<p>For the Now, you have to understand what is required by the FEC and to be put on the ballot in the fifty states.  The basic information for all of this is at <a href="http://fec.gov">http://fec.gov</a></p>

<h2>Then</h2>

<p>For the Then, you have to decide what presidents inspire you and the people of the USA.  There is an advantage of studying current presidents in that the political world
is similar to what it will be for you.  There is an advantage of studying earlier presidents in that enough time has passed to more truly evaluate them.  Plus their
are more of them to pick and chose from than from the last two decades.</p>

<p>So we have (a) current or (b) earlier.  When given an apparent choice like that I have one common answer: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  There is no exclusion, just two options.  Picking
(a) or (b) exclusively would make you unbalanced and likely under-informed in a critical concept to the presidency.  So now that we have the full set of options
available, how do we prioritize which things to read first?  Well, at least one consideration has to be which materials match your time and abilities to read.  In
my case, I am very commonly in my car going somewhere.  So I can&rsquo;t read a book safely.  I need books on tape.  And not all books are on tape.  My second common
situation is being in my car waiting for someone.  At that point I can watch DVDs and read books.  Or even do both.  But again, I have to acquire the books and
some of them are harder than others.</p>

<p>So what happened to me based on availability and diversity is that I am starting with four core biographies</p>

<ul>
<li> Primary Colors (Audio)</li>
<li> FDR (Video)</li>
<li> Steve Jobs (Book)</li>
<li> Reagan (Book) : For this one I have a couple books and I haven&rsquo;t decided which yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also acquired about a dozen more books and even started on &ldquo;Team of Rivals&rdquo;, but the details in the first half didn&rsquo;t seem to be
as pertinent to modern times as the other books, so I shifted it back into the main stack.</p>

<p>If I can through a book a week, I will be able to read fifty books a year.  At worse, it would be closer to thirty.</p>
