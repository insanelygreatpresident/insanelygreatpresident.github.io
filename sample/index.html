  <h2>Insanely Great President – To Serve and Protect</h2>

<p>It is about 5AM as I sit on the tennis court.  The court lights can’t be turned on until 6:03, so the only
lighting comes from a solitary street light.  This day is normal and different.  For almost a year I have been
playing tennis alone in the dark, then alone in the court lights, and then a bit with other people as
they showed up at 7:00 or later.  People would ask me “Are you going to be there?” and the answer was
always the same “yes”.  One morning it was 31°, and I was there.  In skiing clothes.  Another morning it was
pouring rain, and I was there.  I discarded the soaked tennis balls when I was done.  Day after day for
hundreds of days.  Never missed a day.  Until yesterday.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>As a specialist in startups, I know that money can easily be wasted.
Good ideas could be wasted due to bad execution.  Over a total of ten startups,
I had become one of the best execution experts in the shark tank of Silicon Valley.
You have an idea; I can make it happen.  Elon Musk and some others are better than me,
but I am definitely a top-tier professional executor.  So why was I looking for a job
that produced money so I could effect change?  I needed a job that could effect change directly.
And in the flows of my conscious and subconscious mind, I realized I was talking about the
job that needs the ultimate execution specialist.  The ultimate executor who can do great
or horrible things, and at which the whole world looks and hopes: could this person be amazing this time?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>My platform is likely radically different from every other candidates&#8217; platform.  I am not telling
you “We should all be more Green, so vote for me!”, or “We should support the working man more,
so vote for me!”,  or “We are middle America, so vote for me!”, or maybe a dozen other platforms.
Those are not platforms I believe in.  My platform is very simple:</p>

<p>“I work for you, tell me what you want me to do, and I will do my best to make you proud.
And my best is far better than all the other candidates best.”</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Having startups fail is one thing.  Expensive.  Sad.  But not destructive to the whole country or world.
Failing as the president is entirely something else and is totally unacceptable.
And to avoid that, I started reading.</p>
