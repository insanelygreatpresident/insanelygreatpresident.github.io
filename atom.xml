    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two critical aspects of any job are (a) Understanding what is required to submit your application to the proper people and (b) Understanding how great people have
done the job before.   Basically &ldquo;Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Then&rdquo; where &ldquo;Then&rdquo; could include the person currently in the position.</p>

<h2>Now</h2>

<p>For the Now, you have to understand what is required by the FEC and to be put on the ballot in the fifty states.  The basic information for all of this is at <a href="http://fec.gov">http://fec.gov</a></p>

<h2>Then</h2>

<p>For the Then, you have to decide what presidents inspire you and the people of the USA.  There is an advantage of studying current presidents in that the political world
is similar to what it will be for you.  There is an advantage of studying earlier presidents in that enough time has passed to more truly evaluate them.  Plus their
are more of them to pick and chose from than from the last two decades.</p>

<p>So we have (a) current or (b) earlier.  When given an apparent choice like that I have one common answer: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  There is no exclusion, just two options.  Picking
(a) or (b) exclusively would make you unbalanced and likely underinformed in a critical concept to the presidency.  So now that we have the full set of options
available, how do we prioritize which things to read.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am planning on competing at the ATP tournament in Indian Wells in March.  As part of preparing for that tournament, I drove the sixteen-hour round trip in one day.
That was the first day I didn&rsquo;t play tennis (starting at 5AM) for about a year.  Every day, rain or shine, cold or hot, I go out to the court in appropriate attire
and practice.  It is both athletic and meditative.</p>

<p>The day after the Indian Wells trip, I went out for my normal ritual.  It is dark at 5AM, and the tennis court lights can&rsquo;t be turned on until 6:03AM.  After
 doing some of my practice, I sat there on the court.  I must have pondered winning Indian Wells and making a large some of money off that.  If I won, I
 could make quite a bit of money per year.  Playing tennis and being sponsored.  I already make quite a bit of money, so the obvious question to myself
 was &ldquo;why?&rdquo;.  Winning Indian Wells would be notable because I am pretty old: will be 48 years old at the tournament and will turn 49 the month after.
 So there might be some karmic benefit or interesting learning from winning that one tournament.  I was also planning on trying to win the US Open.
 That would be a real one-two punch to the youngsters.</p>

<p>But beyond the one or two punch combo&hellip; why?  Why would I play tennis for money?  What would it mean to the world?  How would I be impacting the world, and
why would I prefer that to my other choices?</p>

<p>I have a number of ways to make money, and I give away a lot of my time to help people (mostly kids).  This is fine, but if I am going to change, it should
be something better.  Ideally much better.  Much more impact.  Positive impact.</p>

<p>I ponder some more and consider my characteristics and abilities.  I care about people deeply.  I care about <em>everyone</em> and not some
specific group of people that matches some of the ideals I have.   I solve problems.  I am an execution expert and can deliver all kinds of great solutions
to solve other people&rsquo;s needs (or my own).</p>

<p>Where would an execution expert who cares deeply about the needs of everyone have the most positive impact?</p>

<p>Click.  There is one job that fills that bill exactly.  President.  President of a country.  President of my country.  POTUS.  President of the United States of America.</p>

<p>That is what I should try to be.  I could have great positive impact in the role.  I would work for hundreds of millions of people to protect and to serve them.
What do these people need?  What problems do they have?  What would be the best solution?  And how would I deliver that solution?</p>

<p>That is an awesome job.  And I may be insanely great at doing it.  But even if I am not elected, I can write about what I think (and experience) an
insanely great president would do.  To prepare, to get elected, and to serve the people of the USA when elected.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Mark Fussell, and I have an unusually large set of honed skills.  These I acquired by surviving Caltech, progressing through a total of ten+ startups,
writing multiple books, raising two daughters, building a relationship with a single wonderful woman over thirty years, becoming a patent expert, and
then a professional tennis player.  That alone might imply some significant depth and diversity.  But it  gets stranger: I am basically a trained financial
expert; a lawyer; a teacher of Robotics, Tennis, Programming, Publishing, and technology in general;
a very good skater and skier; a highly capable marksman with both bullets and arrows; a lover of philosophy and government;
and a driver of many &ldquo;classes&rdquo; of vehicles (Motorcycle, Car, and Bus/MH).</p>

<p>All of the above is due to (a) a love of learning, (b) an ability to focus and listen, and &copy; progressing through failure.  By this point, I have become
an &ldquo;Execution Expert&rdquo; or what I also call &ldquo;A Delivery Boy&rdquo;: you let me know what you want&hellip; and I will deliver that
to you.  As long as it doesn&rsquo;t violate my morals, I can basically do almost anything.  I might need others to help
out, but I will find them as needed.</p>

<p>So that is most of the skinny on me.  You can find out some other information at:</p>
